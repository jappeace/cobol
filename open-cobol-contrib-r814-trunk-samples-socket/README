Six programs demonstrating COBOL socket programming.

1.  tcpipclient.cbl and tcpipserver.cbl:  a pair of
    simple socket programs suitable for learning,
    testing and trying new and different features.

2.  RESTclient.cbl: accessing US Government Census
    data and Yahooapis.com stock market data.

3.  messagesend.cbl, messagepublish.cbl
    and messagereceive.cbl: coordinating activities
    across multiple platforms with UDP messages.

The script compileall will compile these programs
and the supporting subroutines

These examples assume ports 8000, 8001 and 8002
are open. If not, change the port numbers in the
examples and in the subscriberfile.txt file

1.  To test tcpiserver and tcpipclient:
    1.1  start a command line instance and run
         ./tcpipserver localhost 8000
    1.2  start another command line instance and run
         ./tcpipclient localhost 8000 get put ls
         ./tcpipclient localhost 8000 quit

2.  To test RESTclient:
    2.1  start a command line instance and run
         ./RESTclient

    this produces a lot of output, so you might
    want to run
         ./RESTclient > RESTclient.txt
         less RESTclient.txt

3.  To test messagesend, messagepublish
    and messagereceive:
    3.1  start a command line instance and run
         ./messagepublish 8000
    3.2  start another command line instance and run
         ./messagereceive 8001
    3.3  start another command line instance and run         
         ./messagereceive 8002
    3.4  start another command line instance and run
         ./messagesend localhost 8000 backupcomplete
         ./messagesend localhost 8000 load
         ./messagesend localhost 8000 etlcomplete
         ./messagesend localhost 8000 quit

    Look at subscriberfile.txt to see what's going on.

As lagniappe for those of you who like fixed format
uppercase cobol, I extracted changeformat.cbl from
my preprocess1 example, cleaned it up and made some
fixes.
It was originally provided here and can now be found (updated) at
https://svn.code.sf.net/p/open-cobol/contrib/trunk/tools/changeformat/


There are three compile scripts: compileall, compilefixed
and compilefree.

The compile script does not generate dynamic (.so) objects
and produces compiled programs which do not reference
dynamic (.so) objects.


Changelog:

connectoserver calling sequence modified

added sync to connecttoserver address-hints and address-info
for 64-bit platforms.  fixed display length error in tcpipserver.

These programs were developed using GnuCOBOL 2.0.0
Built Oct 10 2013 16:15:17 and Ubuntu 14.04
running on a Lenovo R61i laptop.
